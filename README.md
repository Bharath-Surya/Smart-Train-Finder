# Smart Train Finder

A simple web app to find train connections between Swiss cities using the free public API from https://transport.opendata.ch/.

Note:
Although the original task mentioned the Hamburgâ€“Amsterdam route, I chose to use Swiss cities for the live implementation because:
- The DB Fahrplan API required registration and was not responsive (I encountered domain errors during testing).
- The Transport Open Data API (transport.opendata.ch) provides free, open, and reliable access to real-time train data within Switzerland.
- Using Swiss routes ensured a fully working, real-data-based frontend within the limited time constraints of the task.

For completeness, I also built a mock version simulating Hamburg â†’ Amsterdam data, but the live demo is powered by real API data from Swiss routes to ensure functionality and accuracy.

## Features

- Select from multiple city pairs
- Choose one-way or roundtrip with nights stay
